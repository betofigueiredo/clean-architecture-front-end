# clean-architecture-front-end
A study on how to create a better front-end architecture. Ideas still under development.

### Why
Front-end development is quite recent and I believe, as it grows, it faces challenges that other areas, like back-end development, already faced and resolved it. It's important to study and understand these challenges.
